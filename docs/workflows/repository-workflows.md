# Repository workflows

Repository workflows are versioned Markdown policy in
`.factory/workflows/**/*.md`. Agent Factory refreshes the catalog from the
repository default branch and freezes the selected workflow in each Work
snapshot.

## Frontmatter

Use YAML frontmatter for every workflow. `implement.md` may omit it only as a
legacy fallback; new repositories should include it.

```markdown
---
id: dba/index-review
title: Review database indexes
description: Inspect index coverage and query plans before proposing a change.
github_issue:
  labels_all:
    - team:dba
---

Reproduce the query problem, make the smallest safe change, run focused checks,
and open one tested pull request for human review.
```

`id`, `title`, and `description` identify the workflow. `labels_all` is
optional. When present, every listed label must be on the live GitHub issue;
matching is case-insensitive. Do not use issue title, body, or comments for
routing.

No matching rule selects `implement`. More than one matching rule blocks intake
and records a diagnostic.

## Common workflows

```markdown
---
id: implement
title: Implement a ready ticket
description: Deliver an approved issue as a tested pull request.
---

Implement the smallest cohesive change. Run relevant checks, review the diff,
push a branch, open a linked pull request, and move the Project item to Review.
Never merge or deploy.
```

```markdown
---
id: triage
title: Triage a new ticket
description: Turn an incoming issue into an implementation-ready specification.
github_issue:
  labels_all:
    - factory:ready-for-spec
---

Clarify scope, acceptance criteria, risks, and verification. Route the issue to
human approval. Do not change code or open a pull request.
```

```markdown
---
id: bug-finder
title: Find a verified defect
description: Find one defensible defect and route it for implementation.
github_issue:
  labels_all:
    - factory:bug-finder
---

Prove one non-duplicate defect, open its issue, and route it to the
implementation workflow. Do not change code or open a pull request.
```

Triage and bug-finder are routing-only. Workflows that implement a change,
including DBA and integration workflows, publish tested code PRs.

## GitHub issue loop

```text
Todo / Ready / In Progress / Review / Blocked / Done
Ready + needs-agent
        |
        v
catalog refresh -> labels_all match or implement fallback
        |
        v
In Progress -> tested pull request -> Review + needs-human
```

Admission requires `needs-agent` and Project Ready. The worker rechecks the
live issue before changing it. If catalog refresh, routing, verification,
publishing, or CI is blocked, it comments with the exact blocker and the
workflow may move the item to Blocked. A human owns merge, Done, and
deployment. Factory never merges.

Factory allows up to two repair attempts across three independent review
passes. It preserves unresolved findings for a human.

For issue work, Factory also commits `.factory/plans/issue-<number>.md` on the
work branch as an audit artifact. Reviews preserve that generated plan.

## Demo

From the Agent Factory checkout:

```sh
make demo-start
make demo-issue-search
```

`demo-issue-search` creates a GitHub issue, adds it to Project 1 as `Ready`,
and applies `needs-agent`. Inspect the selected workflow and Work at
`http://127.0.0.1:7339/`, then inspect the linked GitHub issue and pull request.
Stop the isolated demo with `make demo-stop`.
